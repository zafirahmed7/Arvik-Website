Context:
I have had 8 months of experience working as a Project Manager in Tech for a Software Solutions company called Scrift.io
During my time there I worked on managing many projects (mainly websites). My work including website design testing, quality assurance, and stakeholder communication.

Seed:
Using my experience from managing projects and being in close collaboration with devs, I already had a know-how on how the design aspect should work.
In my initial code, I took the boiler-plate code that is usually similar for all e-commerce websites, that includes a navigation bar, appropriate sections, and a footer.

Design Rotational:
The design inspiration came from my own brand's theme. I started an e-commerce store in 2022 named Arvik, a men's accessory store. I have always wanted to build a website for 
my own company, but since we had to close the store down, I never made its website. The company still has its Instagram account, and through the screenshot below you can see the 
similarity in the design. I created the entire instagram page and all its posts and reels when I was 17. <img width="1244" height="629" alt="Arvik" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b8e0269-3483-4169-978c-6dadeaf34d3b" />
Through my work as a professional, I knew the importance of adding a Call To Action (CTA) button on the homepage. I also added a fully functional form.

Here are some pictures of myself, I used to do all the modelling myself.
